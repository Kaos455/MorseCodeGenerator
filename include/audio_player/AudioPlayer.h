// Audio Player
// NO IDEA YET...All i know is it Uses PortAudio
// Have to somehow make a real-time audio generator/player
// Idea -> Create a baseline "Generator" which can be called effectively to generate the Audio buffer based on the "current output buffer"
//		-> Loop through the current output buffer and create a "sound" for each type(dot or dash) and append it to an "audio buffer"

// This Fact of the Application is NOT required for the Project (before the Assignment is due, HOWEVER...I would LIKE to complete it)
