// Create a Good enough Event Object to handle the Events Appropriately
// Properties:
// EventType -> What triggered the Event (Should allow me to generalise Events to "ButtonClick" or "VolumeUp")
// Data -> Pointer or Reference to an Array or something (Should allow me to then pass the input buffer to the generator)
